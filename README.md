# Airport Manager First Class
 
 
The differences between these two classes of airline travel vary quite a lot among airlines, airplane models, and international vs. domestic travel. That said, first class provides more service and better, more spacious seating, at a minimum. Beyond that, first class dining tends to be a cut above business class, and first class airport lounges, especially in Asia, tend to offer more perks, such as chauffeured rides from the lounge to your plane and spa treatments.
 
It may be, especially on an international long-haul flight, because you'll get more amenities and services in first class than you will in business class. These can include a more spacious suite, premium meals and alcohol selections, an onboard shower, and more attentive service. But keep in mind that the cost will typically be even more than the price differential between economy class and business class, which is already pretty steep.

Generally, there are four: economy, premium economy, business, and first class, with the price and level of service increasing with each type of seating. Most, but not all, airlines have all four classes. Also, different airplane models may be configured differently, so it's always a good idea to check your options before you purchase a seat. A seating map for the airline and specific airplane model will tell you what you need to know.
 
I got to the airport at around 5:30AM for my 7:30AM departure to Hong Kong. Cathay Dragon operates out of Terminal 3 at PEK. Upon arriving at the airport I took the train to the international concourse, and then cleared immigration and security, which took nearly 30 minutes.
 
At around 7:20AM the captain made his welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 3hr10min. He said we should be pushing back on time, but that we should expect about 30 minutes on the ground once we started our taxi due to the takeoff queue.
 
A few minutes after that I went to the lavatory, of which there are two at the front of the cabin. As I used it I noticed the door opening (even though it was locked), though I was quick and managed to lock it before the door opened.
 
For the main course I selected the dim sum. I was delighted to for once see an airline offering dim sum without pork, which is almost unheard of. The dim sum included pan fried vegetable and mushroom bun, beef siu mai, yam and sweet potato dumpling, turnip cake, and cordyceps flower har gow.
 
There were two flight attendants working the small first class cabin, and they were attentive and addressed me by name at every interaction. As is often the case on Cathay Pacific at least, the crew stayed out of the cabin, but they always quickly responded to call buttons.
 
Happy New Year - there are not many Cathay Dragon First flights anymore., As you have noticed, there is a significant difference between Dragon Business and Dragon First (I have only flown their First once on a lunch-time flight); always enjoy your reviews and best wishes in 2020;

Just experienced a great KA flight, i've only flown them now twice, but the crew on this last leg were exceptional. Huge recognition for me as OW Emerald - offered me and my family first choice on food and brought ours out early, lots of extra drink refills, and we were all only in economy. As usual, the purser makes a huge difference and she was no exception. Also a fan of KA
 
A lot of the NA flights arrive in the wee hours of the morning and some arrive late at night, but that doesn't mean you still can't get a good view when HK is gorgeous at night as long as there is minimal to no cloud cover or haze!
 
Fall is the season to visit HK (dry, clear/sunny days, and not too hot). Fall is from October to about mid-December. Nowadays, with the number of visitors from Mainland China reduced greatly, I found HK now even more pleasant because of small to no crowds around malls and tourist spots. (Yes, I was just there last month)
 
@[email protected], bad grammar on my part. I meant that I have never seen views of HK harbor from the plane despite many flights to and from the US. I wasn't comparing the city views specifically to US take-off/landing
 
Wow, beef, beef, or beef. I guess one could easily eat around it with the dim sum. As one who doesn't eat red meat but does eat anything else and can \*usually\* find at least one or two agreeable menu options, I always struggle with whether to pre-order a special meal. My biggest fail was on Avianca/TACA, which had pork, pork, or pork (Ben's nightmare).

Delta Air Lines continues to get it right. Recently, the airline eliminated their check-in process to speed up the time it takes for users to check in (#DeltaCheckIn). It's a detail that will expedite travelers' ability to get to where they are going. Despite the fact that many people can already check-in online, Delta is going the extra inch to create a superior customer experience.
 
Recently, I was in Palm Springs and Los Angeles, California USA with my two young adults for a week-long vacation. It was probably our last trip for a while as my children are transitioning into graduating from high school, driving, starting a job, going to college and shifting into less dependence on me and their mother. Making sure the experience was perfect for them was very important to me.
 
Well, imagine my surprise when we checked into Delta Air Lines Sky Priority Lane at Los Angeles International (LAX) for our return flight back to Orlando, and both my daughter and I were upgraded on flight #1649 to first class for our five-hour cross-country trip back to Orlando, FL.
 
Then, as the last group of passengers were boarding, the Delta gate agent came to me and told me that my daughter and I had to give up our seats in first class and move back to seats 26 A & C. This was the last touch point of the trip and this moment created disappointment for both of us and a feeling that something gained was now lost.
 
Justin Simmons, the lead Delta Air Lines agent, understood this idea. He came back to apologize for what happened and said that when he closed out the upgrades, he neglected to see that two first class seats were purchased at the last minute.
 
I understood what happened. However, many customers take opportunities like these to turn to social media or Yelp in order to feel heard. It was significant that Justin took the time to acknowledge our disappointment and mitigate any hard feelings.
 
**If you hear it, you own it.**Once Justin heard about the hiccup, he took ownership of the experience. He could have passed the buck or let us continue on without acknowledging what happened. After all, we did not purchase the first class seats, they were given to us, and it would have been easy to discount our experience.
 
My company was recently acquired and we are now switching over to Concur for travel. During one of the training sessions, the question was asked about booking a flight (in economy) and then paying for an upgrade with either your own points or $. The explanation given was that upgrading / changing your flight with the carrier breaks the data link between the airline/Concur/employer. Is this accurate? I can understand where rebooking a flight could definitely break a data link, but a simple upgrade on a flight only changes your seat location and the ticket/fare class.
 
@daremo999 I'm going to ask my Travel contact about this because I've never heard that explanation about breaking a data link. I'm not saying it is right or wrong, but I've been at SAP Concur for 14 years and never come across it.
 
Just to update anyone reading this in the future. I went ahead and upgraded existing reservations from economy to 1st class several times and had zero issues as it doesnt change the booking at all, just where you are sitting on the plane.
 
I just purchased the upgrade directly through the airline (Delta) in this case. I booked a main cabin fare using Concur, waited a few hours / day for it to be purchased and fully updated in my Delta Skymiles account and then when I logged in to look at the flight, I changed my seating assignment up to first class and paid the cost of that with my own card. Didnt change anything as far as I know and I haven't gotten any blowback about it either.
